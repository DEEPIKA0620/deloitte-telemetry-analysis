# Daikibo Machine Telemetry Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship on Forage.

Daikibo Industrials collected telemetry data from machines across four global factories to understand machine breakdown patterns. The objective was to identify the factory with the highest number of machine failures and determine which machine types failed most frequently.

## Factories Analyzed
- Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

## Tools Used
- Tableau (data visualization and analysis)
- JSON telemetry dataset

## Analysis Performed
- Unified telemetry data from all factories
- Identified unhealthy machine events
- Aggregated machine failures by factory and machine type
- Used filters and visualizations to compare breakdown frequency

## Key Insights
- Certain factories experienced a higher number of machine breakdowns
- Specific machine types showed recurring failure patterns
- These insights can help prioritize maintenance and reduce downtime
- 
## Data Availability
The original telemetry JSON dataset is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

The analysis was performed using the dataset provided as part of the Deloitte Virtual Internship on Forage.

## Disclaimer
This project uses simulated data provided for educational purposes as part of a virtual internship.
